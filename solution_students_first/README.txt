Solutions obtained with a variation of the Gale Shapeley algorithm.

At pass n, we assigned 'non assigned students' to their choice n. 
 If there is not enough place among them, we fill the school using school 
 preferences among the students assigned on the last pass (not on all students 
 assigned before like the Gale Shapley algorithm)

Usually much more students get their first choice, but it creates instability and
a little more students are left without a school at the end.
